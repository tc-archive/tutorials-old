#  - Write a function that returns true if a single-quoted string contains only printable ASCII 
#    characters (space through tilde).
# 
#  - Write anagram?(word1, word2) that returns true if its parameters are anagrams.
# 
#  - Try the following in iex:
#    iex> [ 'cat' | 'dog' ] ['cat',100,111,103]
#    Why does iex print ‘cat’ as a string, but ‘dog’ as individual numbers?
# 
#  - (Harder) Write a function that takes a single-quoted string of the form number [+-*/] number and
#    returns the result of the calculation. The individual numbers do not have leading plus or minus 
#    signs.
#    calculate('123 + 27') # => 150
