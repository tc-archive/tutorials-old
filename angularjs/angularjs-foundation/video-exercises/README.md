# AngularJS Foundation - Hands On Exercises

Welcome to the hands on exercises for the [Build a Strong AngularJS Foundation](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000151.do) course.

#### The course was divided into three parts
1. Commentary on a specific AngularJS concept.
2. A live coding example to illustrate the concept.
3. Hands on exercises to reinforce the concept.

This is the third section of the course and it is time for us to work through the hands on exercises.

Each module has a set of exercises and a suite of failing unit tests. As you work through the exercises, the tests will start to pass. You will know that you have successfully completed the exercises when all of the tests are passing.

Checkout `master` from the [angularjs-foundation/video-app](https://github.com/angularjs-foundation/video-app) repository to see the completed application and solutions to the exercises.
