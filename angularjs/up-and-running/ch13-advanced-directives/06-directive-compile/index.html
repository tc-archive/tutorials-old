<!--
In the directive life cycle, we mentioned that a directive goes through two 
distinct phases: a 'compile' step and a 'link' step. We explored the link step in 
detail; now we dig into the compile step.

By the time we get to the link step of the directive, the directive’s HTML has 
already been parsed and all the relevant directives within it have been picked up 
by the AngularJS compiler and attached to the correct scope. At this point, if we 
dynamically add any directives to the HTML or do large-scale DOM manipulation that 
involves integration with existing AngularJS directives, it won’t work correctly.

The compile step in a directive is the correct place to do any sort of HTML 
template manipulation and DOM transformation. We never use the link and compile 
functions together, because when we use the compile key, we have to return a 
linking function from within it instead.
