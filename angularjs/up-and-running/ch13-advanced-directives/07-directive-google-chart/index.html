Integrating 3rd Party Libraries

1.  Depending on the library, wait for the library to load before starting our 
    directive.

2.  Take in the data from a controller, and convert it into a format suitable 
    for our third-party component.

3.  Display the data using the third-party component.

4.  Whenever the data changes inside AngularJS, update the third-party 
    component.

5.  Listen for events from the third-party component and pass them to the 
    relevant controller through function bindings.


This will render the chart with the initial data. When we click the button in the 
page, the data gets updated in the controller. Because the data is passed to the 
directive by reference, the directive gets the latest data as well and the watch 
function is triggered. This updates the chart with the latest values and we get an 
automatically updating UI with no additional work.

    <!--
    We use the pie chart as an attribute directive, and pass it some 
    configuration as well as the data it needs in order to display as arguments
    to the directive. This allows us to make it reusable instead of tying it 
    down to a specific service or the same configuration object every time.
