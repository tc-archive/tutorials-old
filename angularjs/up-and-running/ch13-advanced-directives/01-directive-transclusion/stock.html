    Basic Transclusion

    Basic transclusion can be thought of as a two-step process:
    
    1.  First, we tell the directive that we are going to use transclusion as 
        part of this directive. This tells AngularJS that whenever the 
        directive is  encountered in the HTML, to make a copy of its content 
        and store it so that it’s not lost when AngularJS replaces it with the 
        directive’s template. This is accomplished by setting the key 
        transclude to true as part of the directive definition object.
  
    2.  Second, we need to tell AngularJS where to put the content that was 
        stored in the template. This is accomplished by using the 
        'ng-transclude' directive, which ensures that the content that was 
        captured is made a child of the element in the directive template.
