      The default behavior of any AngularJS directive, in that if it has a 
      template or templateUrl, it will remove the content of the element where 
      the directive is found and replace it with the template specified in the 
      directive definition object.
 
      However, in cases, where we want AngularJS to respect both the inner 
      contents where the directive is used, as well as the original template 
      of the directive, we use the concept of 'transclusion'.
