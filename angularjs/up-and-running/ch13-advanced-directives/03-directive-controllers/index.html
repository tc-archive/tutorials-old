<!-- 
*** Directive Controller Application Flow ***

1.  When the tabs directive (the parent one) is found in the HTML, the content 
    is transcluded and a space for the tabs is preserved in the HTML (using 
    'ng-repeat'). The actual tabs are inserted below it.

2.  Each individual tab registers with the parent,so that the parent tabs 
    controller can decide which tab is 'currently selected', and 'highlight'  
    and 'hide/show' the other tabs as needed.

3.  Each tab again uses transclusion on its content to wrap it in a container 
    so that it can be hidden and shown as needed.

4.  On registration,the 'tabs controller' sets the very first tab as 'selected' 
    (using a scope variable on the scope passed up to the 'tabs controller').

5.  After that, the 'ng-click' handles 'hiding' and 'showing' of the individual 
    tabs using the functions defined on the scope of the tabs directive.
