<!-- Validation Output States

  When a 'named form' is specified AngularJS creates a FormController that holds the current
  state of the form as well as some helper methods. The FormController can be accessed using
  the formâ€™s name. The following state is exposed.

  $error
  This field on the form houses all the individual fields and the errors on each form element 
  We will talk more about this in the following section.

  $invalid (CSS: ng-invalid)
  AngularJS sets this state when any of the validations (required, ng-minlength, and others)
  mark any of the fields within the form as invalid.

  $valid (CSS: ng-valid)
  The inverse of the previous state, which states that all the validations in the form are
  currently evaluating to correct.

  $pristine (CSS: ng-pristine)
  All forms in AngularJS start with this state. This allows you to figure out if a user has
  started typing in and modifying any of the form elements. Possible usage: disabling the 
  reset button if a form is pristine.

  $dirty (CSS: ng-dirty)
  The inverse of$pristine, which states that the user made some changes (he can revert it, 
  but the$dirty bit is set).

  
  Each of the states mentioned in the table (except $error) are Booleans and can be used to 
  conditionally hide, show, disable, or enable HTML elements in the UI.
