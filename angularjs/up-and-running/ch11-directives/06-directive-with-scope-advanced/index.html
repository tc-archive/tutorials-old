<!-- 
We added a template to our directive using the templateUrl key, its own 
functionality and business logic using the link function, and made it fully 
contained and reusable by passing it any data it needed using an isolated scope.
We explored the various options and ways in which we can pass data to isolated scope, including objects, strings, and functions. Finally, we looked at the 
replace option of the directive.

  <title>Stock Market App</title>

<body ng-app="stockMarketApp">

  <div ng-controller="MainCtrl as mainCtrl">
    <h3>List of Stocks</h3>
    <!--
    See: 'directive.js' 'stockWidget' 'scope'.

    - stock-data="s" 
      Bind this 's' to '$scope.stockData' as an object.

    - "Stock {{$index}}. {{s.name}}"
      Bind this 'string expression' to '$scope.stockTitle' as a string.
       * Takes a string value, which also allows for string interpola‐ tions (or 
         handling the {{ }} syntax), so we can pass it a combination of hardcoded
         text and variable values

    - "mainCtrl.onStockSelect(stockPrice, stockName)"
      Bind this 'controller function' to '$scope.whenSelect' as a function.
      * Takes the reference of the function it calls, along with the parameter 
        names for the function. It only makes a reference of this function avail‐
        able to our directive, and it’s up to us to decide when this function is 
        actually triggered

        !!! Do note that the key names specified in the HTML have to exactly 
            match those provided by our directive. Although, the html tag can 
            define which variable are passed to the controller function and 
            their order.
