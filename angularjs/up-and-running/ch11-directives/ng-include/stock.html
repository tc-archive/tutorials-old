<!-- HTML Partials

Any time we have to serve HTML partials, we need an HTTP server because the 
browser does not allow serving or requesting files on the file:// protocol. 
So to make this application work on our local machine, we have a few options:

• Install Node’s http-server by running 'sudo npm install -g http-server'. Then 
  run 'http-server' from the directory that contains index.html.

• Python addicts can run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' from the folder where the 
  index.html file is as well.

• Finally, WebStorm can start a built-in server when you ask it to open the 
  'index.html' file in a browser.
