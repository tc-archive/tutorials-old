    The 'ng-switch' directive acts like a switch statement in the HTML. It takes a variable 
    (using the on attribute, which in this case is MainCtrlâ€™s tab), and then, depending on 
    the state, hides and shows elements (using the ng-switch-when attribute, used as children 
    of the ng-switch). The ng-switch-when takes the value that the variable should take.

    Both of the tabs, First and Second, are using the same controller, SubCtrl. But each one 
    has its own instance of the list variable. Adding items in one tab does not add them to 
    the other, and vice versa.
